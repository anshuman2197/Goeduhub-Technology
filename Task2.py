"""Yes a list need to be Homogeneous because Lists and tuples are mostly identical in Python, except that lists are mutable and
tuples are immutable. Both lists and tuples can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous. 
If we want sequences with enforced homogeneity, use the array module or use NumPy.lists must be homogenous and tuples must be 
fixed-length.Tuples are used as anonymous structures. It is the same way in mathematics. Python's type system, however, 
does not allow us to make these distinctions,we can make tuples of dynamic length, and can make lists with heterogeneous data."""
